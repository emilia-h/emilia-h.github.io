<p>I am a computer science student and this website is where I place my personal projects and ramblings.</p>

<p>
    I believe in simple web design, so this whole website is written using only HTML and CSS and a little bit of
    JavaScript sprinkled in. To prevent copy-pasting and duplication, I run a straightforward Python script that takes a
    <code>template.html</code> file and a page file and combines them.
</p>

<p>
    Right now I am hosting a domain at a registrar and hosting the static website using GitHub Pages. The source for
    this website and the generator code I use
    <a href="https://github.com/emilia-h/emilia-h.github.io">can be viewed on GitHub</a>.
