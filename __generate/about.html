<p>I am a computer science student and this website is where I place my personal projects and ramblings.</p>

<p>
    I believe in simple web design, so this whole website is written using only HTML and CSS and a little bit of
    JavaScript sprinkled in. To prevent copy-pasting and duplication, I run a straightforward Python script that takes a
    <code>template.html</code> file and a page file and combines them.
</p>

<p>
    Right now I am hosting a domain at a registrar and hosting the static website using GitHub Pages. The source for
    this website and the generator code I use
    <a href="https://github.com/emilia-h/emilia-h.github.io">can be viewed on GitHub</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The following JavaScript libraries are used (only on the pages where they are necessary) on the client side:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>For rendering LaTeX: <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a></li>
    <li>
        For syntax highlighting: <a href="https://highlightjs.org/">highlight-js</a> (although I do not load this
        library on pages where you see syntax, I just use <a href="/tools/syntax-highligher">my own tool</a> and then
        paste the resulting HTML directly on the web page).
    </li>
</ul>
