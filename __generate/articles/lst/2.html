<h2 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>
    <a href="/articles/lst/1">Last chapter</a>, we saw how to translate statements in English to formulas, with a
    variable for each piece of the sentence. We also saw truth tables and what contradictions/tautologies are.
</p>

<p>
    In this chapter, we will learn how to <strong>prove</strong> a formula, which means showing that it is a tautology.
    We could do this by listing all combinations using a truth table, but we saw that these can get enormous, so we
    need a better method for proving than listing all options. This is why we will use
    <strong>natural deduction</strong> to prove formulas.
</p>

<h2 id="assumptions-and-proof-goals"><a href="#assumptions-and-proof-goals">Assumptions and Proof Goals</a></h2>

<p>Suppose we would like to prove that the following complicated-looking formula is a tautology:</p>

<p>\( ((a \Rightarrow b) \land a) \Rightarrow b \)</p>

<p>
    We will write a proof for this in a structured manner. At the bottom of the proof, we write the
    <strong>proof goal</strong>. At the top, we write <strong>assumptions</strong>, which are valid only within a
    certain context. In between, we write intermediate facts that we use to go from assumptions to the prove goal.
</p>

<p>
    We start by determining the "top-level" symbol of the formula. In the example, this is \( \Rightarrow \), because
    we can split up the formula in two subformulas \( (a \Rightarrow b) \land a \) and \( b \), connected with
    \( \Rightarrow \). The parentheses help to guide us here.
</p>

<p>
    Just like we had a <a href="/articles/lst/cheatsheet-logic#boolean-operators" target="_blank">truth table</a> for
    each symbol, we also have proof rules for each symbol, of the following two types:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Introduction rules</strong>: these are rules that "build" a bigger formula from smaller facts. In
        practice, you use these rules when you have a proof goal that you need to work toward, but you don't know yet
        how to prove it (you work backward from the proof goal).
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Elimination rules</strong>: these are rules that "deconstruct" a formula into a smaller formula. In
        practice, you use these rules for reasoning steps (you work forward from assumptions and existing facts).
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="rules-for-implication"><a href="#rules-for-implication">Rules for \( \Rightarrow \)</a></h2>

<p>
    The <strong>introduction rule for \( \Rightarrow \)</strong> says that if you assume the left-hand side \( X \)
    and manage to prove, using this assumption, that the right-hand side \( Y \) is true, then you may conclude that
    \( X \Rightarrow Y \) is true. It would be written down as follows:
</p>

<div class="proof">
    <div>assume \( X \)</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>    ...</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>    { new proof goal }</div>
    <div>    \( Y \)</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>{ by introduction rule for \( \Rightarrow \) }</div>
    <div>\( X \Rightarrow Y \)</div>
</div>

<p>
    The extra spacing makes it extra clear where it is allowed to use the assumption, while the lines in {} are
    comments to explain your steps. You could compare it to writing something like Python code for a program, except
    this is for a proof.
</p>

<p>
    The <strong>elimination rule for \( \Rightarrow \)</strong> says that if you know that an implication
    \( X \Rightarrow Y \) holds true, and you have proven that the left-hand side \( X \) is true, then you may
    conclude that the right-hand side \( Y \) holds true. It would be written down as follows:
</p>

<div class="proof">
    <div>\( X \Rightarrow Y \)</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>...</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>\( X \)</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>...</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>{ by elimination rule for \( \Rightarrow \) }</div>
    <div>\( Y \)</div>
</div>

<p>
    I intentionally wrote upper-case \( X \) and \( Y \), because they do not have to be variables; they can also be
    more complex subformulas.
</p>

<p>
    Now we can use the introduction rule to prove the example at the start! This is because we were trying to prove
    something where the top-level symbol was \( \Rightarrow \). This step would be written as follows:
</p>

<div class="proof">
    <div>assume \( (a \Rightarrow b) \land a \)</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>    ... still left to do ...</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>    { by what rule? }</div>
    <div>    \( b \)</div>
    <div>{ by introduction rule for \( \Rightarrow \) }</div>
    <div>\( ((a \Rightarrow b) \land a) \Rightarrow b \)</div>
</div>

<p>
    We have filled in some of the gaps of our proof, but note that it is not complete yet. We need other rules to
    finish the proof.
</p>

<h2 id="rules-for-conjunction"><a href="#rules-for-conjunction">Rules for \( \land \)</a></h2>

<p>
    The <strong>introduction rule for \( \land \)</strong> is a lot simpler. If you know that \( X \) is true and that
    \( Y \) is true, then you may conclude that \( X \land Y \) is true:
</p>

<div class="proof">
    <div>\( X \)</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>...</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>\( Y \)</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>...</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>{ by introduction rule for \( \land \) }</div>
    <div>\( X \land Y \)</div>
</div>

<p>Notice that this introduction rule does not give you an assumption!</p>

<p>
    The <strong>elimination rules for \( \land \)</strong> (there are 2) are also quite simple. If you know that
    \( X \land Y \) holds, then you may conclude \( X \):
</p>

<div class="proof">
    <div>\( X \land Y \)</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>{ by elimination rule for \( \land \) }</div>
    <div>\( X \)</div>
</div>

<p>Similarly, if you know that \( X \land Y \) holds, then you may conclude \( Y \):</p>

<div class="proof">
    <div>\( X \land Y \)</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>{ by elimination rule for \( \land \) }</div>
    <div>\( Y \)</div>
</div>

<h2 id="finishing-the-example-proof"><a href="#finishing-the-example-proof">Finishing the Example Proof</a></h2>

<p>We already had the following part of the proof:</p>

<div class="proof">
    <div>assume \( (a \Rightarrow b) \land a \)</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>    ... still left to do ...</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>    { by what rule? }</div>
    <div>    \( b \)</div>
    <div>{ by introduction rule for \( \Rightarrow \) }</div>
    <div>\( ((a \Rightarrow b) \land a) \Rightarrow b \)</div>
</div>

<p>
    First of all, we can use the elimination rule for \( \land \) <em>twice</em> to continue the proof for our
    example:
</p>

<div class="proof">
    <div>assume \( (a \Rightarrow b) \land a \)</div>
    <div>    { by elimination rule for \( \land \) }</div>
    <div>    \( a \Rightarrow b \)</div>
    <div>    { by elimination rule for \( \land \) }</div>
    <div>    \( a \)</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>    ... still left to do ...</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>    { by what rule? }</div>
    <div>    \( b \)</div>
    <div>{ by introduction rule for \( \Rightarrow \) }</div>
    <div>\( ((a \Rightarrow b) \land a) \Rightarrow b \)</div>
</div>

<p>For the last step, we can use the elimination rule for \( \Rightarrow \) to bridge the gap:</p>

<div class="proof">
    <div>assume \( (a \Rightarrow b) \land a \)</div>
    <div>    { by elimination rule for \( \land \) }</div>
    <div>    \( a \Rightarrow b \)</div>
    <div>    { by elimination rule for \( \land \) }</div>
    <div>    \( a \)</div>
    <div>    { by elimination rule for \( \Rightarrow \) }</div>
    <div>    \( b \)</div>
    <div>{ by introduction rule for \( \Rightarrow \) }</div>
    <div>\( ((a \Rightarrow b) \land a) \Rightarrow b \)</div>
</div>

<h2 id="incorrect-reasoning"><a href="#incorrect-reasoning">Incorrect Reasoning</a></h2>

<p>
    It is important to remember that assumptions and facts can only be used within the context that they were made,
    unless there is a specific rule for it. The indentation also helps to make this more obvious. An example of an
    INCORRECT proof that \( a \Rightarrow b \) is a tautology (which it clearly isn't) would be:
</p>

<div class="proof">
    <div>assume \( a \) (1)</div>
    <div>    assume \( b \) (2)</div>
    <div>        { from assumption (2) }</div>
    <div>        \( b \)</div>
    <div>    { by introduction rule for \( \Rightarrow \) }</div>
    <div>    \( b \Rightarrow b \)</div>
    <div>    { from assumption (2) (NOT ALLOWED!) }</div>
    <div>    \( b \)</div>
    <div>{ by introduction rule for \( \Rightarrow \) }</div>
    <div>\( a \Rightarrow b \)</div>
</div>

<p>
    We used assumption (2) to prove that \( b \Rightarrow b \), which is completely valid, but we then tried to use
    that assumption outside of its intended scope, which leads to the incorrect conclusion that \( a \Rightarrow b \)
    is a tautology.
</p>

<h2 id="exercises"><a href="#exercises">Exercises</a></h2>

<ol>
    <li>
        Prove that the following formulas are tautologies, using natural deduction:

        <ol>
            <li>\( (a \land b) \Rightarrow a \)</li>
            <li>\( ((a \Rightarrow b) \land (b \Rightarrow c)) \Rightarrow (a \Rightarrow c) \)</li>
            <li>\( ((a \land b) \Rightarrow c) \Rightarrow (a \Rightarrow (b \Rightarrow c)) \)</li>
            <li>\( (a \Rightarrow (b \Rightarrow c)) \Rightarrow ((a \land b) \Rightarrow c) \)</li>
        </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
        For the following formulas, if they are tautologies, prove it; otherwise, give values to \( a \), \( b \) and
        \( c \) to show that it also can be false (this is called giving a <strong>counterexample</strong>):

        <ol>
            <li>\( a \Rightarrow (a \land b) \)</li>
            <li>\( a \Rightarrow (b \Rightarrow a) \)</li>
            <li>\( (b \Rightarrow a) \Rightarrow a \)</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Although this is just an introduction to proving, these concepts are still the "real deal" and are used in
    basically every proof made by computer scientists (though they may use different notation or leave out some
    details). In the next chapter, we're going to look at a few more rules that are needed for the other connectives
    like \( \lor \), \( \lnot \) and \( \Leftrightarrow \). Make sure to do the exercises before moving on to the next
    chapter!
