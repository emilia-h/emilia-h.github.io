<p>
    There are many articles online about graphs and (1-)connected components, but not many about biconnected components
    (BCCs), even though these are way more interesting and can be used to solve many problems! Especially in
    competitive programming it is vital to know about this technique.
</p>

<p>
    I will outline what biconnected components are, how they work similar to/different from connected components, and
    how to find them algorithmically (with C++ code included). Presumed knowledge is knowing what a graph is. Sections:

<p>
    Let's introduce the concept by looking at a problem that BCCs could help solve.
</p>

<p>
    Charlotte is a secret agent for Enforcement of Metro Integrity (EMI), and she is tasked with transporting a
    top-secret package from one of her informants, Alice, to an undercover agent, Bob. Alice and Bob must not meet each
    other, because that would ruin the safety of the mission, so they must be at different metro stations, and
    Charlotte can naturally only use the metro network for transport. The matter is further complicated by the fact
    that Eve, Charlotte's adversary, is trying to sabotage the mission by disabling one unknown metro connection! For
    the sets of meeting locations \( A \) where Alice can meet and \( B \) where Bob can meet, how many possible pairs
    \( (a, b) \) are there such that Charlotte can safely transport the package from \( a \) to \( b \) no matter which
    line Eve disables?
</p>

<img style="width: min(100%, 30em);" class="light-mode-only" src="/images/algorithms/bcc/light-example-1.svg" />

<p><em>
    Example metro network 1: nodes in the \( A \) set are marked with an A, nodes in the \( B \) set are marked with a
    B; an example valid pair of locations would be \( (3, 1) \), because no matter which metro line Eve chooses to
    sabogate, there is still a path from \( 3 \) to \( 1 \).
</em></p>

<p>
    The metro network is a graph \( G \) with \( n \) nodes (metro stations) and \( m \) edges (metro lines).
    \( A \) and \( B \) are then subsets of the set of nodes \( V(G) \). We are trying to find an algorithm with the
    best possible running time. We can use the following definition to make the objective a bit more precise:
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Definition:</strong> two nodes \( a, b \) are <em>edge-biconnected</em> if for any edge \( e \), there
    exists a path from \( a \) to \( b \) that does not go through \( e \).
</p>

<p>
    Then in this problem we are trying to count the number of pairs \( (a, b) \) with \( a \in A \) and \( b \in B \)
    that are edge-biconnected. After all, no matter what edge Eve sabotages, we always still have a path between the
    two nodes.
</p>

<p>
    The most naive algorithm would be to consider each \( a \in A \) and \( b \in B \). We would then go over each
    edge, remove it, and check if there is still a path from \( a \) to \( b \) using a simple graph traversal. This
    approach would have a time complexity of \( O(|A| \cdot |B| \cdot m \cdot (n + m)) \), which is very bad.
</p>

<p>
    We could try to speed up this approach by precomputing for each edge the connected components (CCs) of the graph
    without that edge, making the path checking constant time. First we would start with the set of all \( (a, b) \)
    pairs, and iteratively remove pairs that we find can be blocked off by Eve's sabotage. Then we would iterate over
    each of the \( m \) edges, and: (1) remove it and compute for each node in which connected component it lies
    (\( O(m + n) \) time using a simple graph traversal), and (2) for each \( (a, b) \) pair, remove it if they do not
    both lie in the same connected component (now a constant time operation, so \( O(|A| \cdot |B|) \) overall). This
    leads to to a complexity of \( O(m \cdot ((n + m) + |A| \cdot |B|)) \), which is definitely an improvement,
    and we considered how to leverage connected components. Click through the animation below to see how this algorithm
    would work (the dashed circles indicate connected components with the edge removed). However, the running time is
    still quite miserable.

    The final set of pairs is \( \{ (3, 1), (4, 1), ~~ (2, 2), ~~ (7, 5), (7, 8), (8, 5), (8, 8) \} \).
</p>

<p>
    In this example, we are definitely doing a lot of unnecessary work, and you might also notice that the final set of
    pairs has a specific pattern to it (whitespace to make this a bit more obvious). First of all, for each pair there
    exist two edge-disjoint paths like discussed from the A node to the B node:
</p>

<p>We can (suggestively) draw the pairs in the graph as follows:</p>

<img class="light-mode-only" style="width: min(100%, 30em);" src="/images/algorithms/bcc/light-example-1-all-pairs.svg" />

<p>
    Notice that we just have a few clusters of nodes, and within each cluster every possible pair is interconnected (a
    clustering like this is called a <em>partition</em> of the nodes). Can we prove that we can always find such a
    clustering/partition? Or could it be that in some graph, there is an edge-biconnected pair \( x, y \), an
    edge-biconnected pair \( y, z \), but not an edge-biconnected pair \( x, z \)? (Think about counterexamples, or
    convince yourself this should always hold.)
</p>

<h2 id="edge-biconnected-components"><a href="#edge-biconnected-components">Edge-Biconnected Components</a></h2>

<p>
    Okay, I am kind of giving it away by naming this section like this. But it is a very doable exercise to prove that
    such a partition is always possible, where within each cluster all the pairs are connected through a pair of
    edge-disjoint paths, and between two distinct clusters, there are no pairs connected in that way. When thinking
    about partitions, you should always think about the mathematical concept of an <em>equivalence relation</em>. If
    edge-biconnectedness were an equivalence relation, we would need to prove the following three properties:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Reflexivity: any node \( u \) is edge-biconnected to itself.</li>
    <li>Symmetry: if \( u \) is edge-biconnected to \( v \), then \( v \) must be edge-biconnected to \( u \).</li>
    <li>
        Transitivity: if \( u \) is edge-biconnected to \( v \) and \( v \) is edge-biconnected to \( w \), then \( u \)
        must be edge-biconnected to \( w \).
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    It turns out that edge-biconnectedness is in fact an equivalence relation. The proofs for these properties are
    definitely doable to do for yourself! (Try this! Or look at the proof for the first property and then try the other
    two yourself. For transitivity, you have consider that the two assumed paths can be overlapping.) Regardless, I
    will give the proof here, together with a "proof by picture":
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Reflexivity: let \( u \) be any node. Obviously no matter what edge we remove, we still have a path from
        \( u \) going to itself, namely the empty path. Therefore, \( u \) is edge-biconnected to \( u \).
    </li>
    <li>
        Symmetry: let \( u \) and \( v \) be any nodes, assume that \( u \) is edge-biconnected to \( v \), and let
        \( e \) be any edge that we must not use. Because \( u \) was edge-biconnected to \( v \), we can choose
        \( p \) to be the path from \( u \) to \( v \) that does not use \( e \). Because this path lives in an
        undirected graph, we can reverse the path to get a path from \( v \) to \( u \) that still does not use
        \( e \). Therefore, \( v \) is edge-biconnected to \( u \).
    </li>
    <li>
        Transitivity: let \( u \), \( v \) and \( w \) be any nodes, assume that \( u \) is edge-biconnected to
        \( v \) and that \( v \) is edge-biconnected to \( w \), and let \( e \) be any edge that we must not use.
        Because \( u \) was edge-biconnected to \( v \), we can choose \( p \) to be the path from \( u \) to \( v \)
        that does not use \( e \). Because \( v \) was edge-biconnected to \( w \), we can choose \( q \) to be the
        path from \( v \) to \( w \). If \( p \) and \( q \) do not overlap in any edges, simply concatenate to get a
        path \( p q \) from \( u \) to \( w \). If they do however overlap at some point, take the subpath \( p' \) of
        \( p \) from \( u \) to the earliest point where the overlap, take the subpath \( q' \) of \( q \) from that
        point to \( w \), and concatenate to get a path \( p' q' \) from \( u \) to \( w \) that does not use \( e \)
        and does not overlap with itself. Therefore in either case, \( v \) is edge-biconnected to \( w \). (See
        figure.)
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    This gives us a new algorithm for our problem. First compute the edge-biconnected components for the entire graph.
    Then within each component count how many \( A \) nodes and how many \( B \) nodes there are. Because within a
    component each pair of nodes is edge-biconnected, we can simply multiply the A count by the B count and add this
    value to the result. Between any two different components there are no edge-biconnected pairs, we are not missing
    any pairs. Now all we need is an algorithm for computing edge-biconnected components!
</p>

<h2 id="edge-biconnected-component-algorithm"><a href="#edge-biconnected-component-algorithm">Edge-Biconnected Component Algorithm</a></h2>

<p>
    As could be seen in the example of our connected-component-based algorithm, there are certain edges that, when
    removed, will split up the graph into more connected components. These edges are called <em>bridges</em>. If we can
    find the bridges of the graph, then finding the edge-biconnected components will be very easy, because they are
    simply the connected components of the graph with all bridges removed. We can show this by proving the fact that
    two nodes are edge-biconnected if and only if they are in the same connected component of the graph with all
    bridges removed (you can safely skip it, but see the <a href="#proof1">appendix</a> for the proof).
</p>

<p>
    The algorithm for finding bridges was invented by famous computer scientist Robert Tarjan and only uses depth-first
    search. (Fun fact: Tarjan's brother James was a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Tarjan">chess grandmaster</a>.) TODO
</p>

<h2 id="edge-disjoint-paths"><a href="#edge-disjoint-paths">Bonus: Edge-Disjoint Paths</a></h3>

<p>
    Another way to state the edge-biconnectedness property is that there exist two edge-disjoint paths from \( a \) to
    \( b \), i.e., paths that do not have any of the same edges. For instance, in the example there are two
    edge-disjoint paths from node 3 to 1: one that goes from 3 directly to 1, and one that goes from 3 through 6 to 1.
    However, there are no two edge-disjoint paths from node 2 to 5: any path must go through the same edge
    \( \{ 4, 8 \} \), so we cannot choose two paths to be fully edge-disjoint. The proof that this is a property that
    holds if and only if the nodes are edge-biconnected is not trivial. You can see the picture for an example that we
    have two edge-disjoint paths for each edge-biconnected pair, but not for any other pairs:

<p>
    We can repeat the problem that we stated before but change one thing: what if after you picking a station for Alice
    and one for Bob, Eve sabotages a metro station instead of a metro line? (She would not be able to sabotage the
    metro station that Alice or Bob was in.) Do we still have an equivalence relation on the nodes like with
    edge-biconnectedness? I will not discuss it in this article, but consider the following example and think about if
    the transitivity property holds for vertex-biconnectedness:
</p>

<img class="light-mode-only" style="width: min(100%, 30em);" src="/images/algorithms/bcc/light-example-2.svg" />

<p>
    I will also leave you with a hint: a node can be part of multiple vertex-biconnected components. Consider instead
    an equivalence relation on the edges (it's a cute little symmetry that edge-biconnectedness induces an equivalence
    relation on the vertices, and vertex-biconnectedness induces an equivalence relation on the edges).
</p>

<h2 id="terminology-index"><a href="#terminology-index">Appendix: List of Relevant Terms</a></h2>

<p>
    Here is a list of terms used in the theory for edge-biconnectedness and vertex-biconnectedness:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <em>Edge-biconnectedness</em> (for pairs of nodes): a node \( u \) is edge-biconnected to a node \( v \) if
        there exist two edge-disjoint paths from \( u \) to \( v \).
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Edge-biconnectedness</em> (for whole undirected graphs): a graph is edge-biconnected if the graph is
        connected even if any one edge is removed.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Edge-biconnected components</em>: a subset of nodes forms an edge-biconnected component if each pair of
        nodes within it is edge-biconnected, and it cannot have any additional nodes added to it and still have this
        property. (The edge-biconnected components of any graph are the equivalence classes of the edge-biconnectedness
        equivalence relation.)
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Bridge</em>: an edge is a bridge if, when removed, the number of connected components is increased (in the
        example graph there are two such edges, which you can see by stepping through the second figure).
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Vertex-biconnectedness</em> (for pairs of nodes): a node \( u \) is vertex-biconnected to a node \( v \) if
        there exist two vertex-disjoint paths from \( u \) to \( v \), or \( u = v \). (Note that this is not an
        equivalence relation.)
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Vertex-biconnectedness</em> (for whole undirected graphs): a graph is vertex-biconnected if the graph is
        connected even if any one node is removed.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Vertex-biconnected component</em>: a subset of nodes forms a vertex-biconnected component if each pair of
        nodes within it is vertex-biconnected, and it cannot have any additional nodes added to it and still have this
        property. (Note that the vertex-biconnected components of a graph are not necessarily a partition of the
        nodes.)
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Articulation point</em>: a node is an articulation point if it is part of more than one vertex-biconnected
        component.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="proof1"><a href="#proof1">Appendix: Proof of Connection between Edge-Biconnectedness and Bridges</a></h2>

<p>
    For convenience, define \( G' \) to be \( G \) with all bridges removed. Let \( u \) and \( v \) be arbitrary
    nodes.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Assume \( u \) and \( v \) are edge-biconnected. For a contradiction, assume \( u \) and \( v \) are not in the
        same connected component of \( G' \), i.e., all paths from \( u \) to \( v \) go through some bridge. Since
        edge-biconnectedness implies connectedness, there must exist at least one path \( p \) between them, and choose
        \( e \) to be a bridge that this path goes through. From edge-biconnectedness, we can instead choose a path
        \( q \) that does not use the edge \( e \). Choose \( C \) to be the first connected component of \( G' \) that
        \( q \) passes through and that \( p \) also goes through, and that is not just the connected component that
        \( u \) lies in (we know such a connected component must exist, because \( p \) and \( q \) at least meet in
        the component of \( v \) in \( G' \), and that component is separate from the component of \( u \) because we
        passed through the bridge \( e \)). We can join up these paths \( p \) and \( q \) in that connected component
        through edges that are not bridges. Now we have a cycle passing through a bridge, which is a contradiction
        because it implies that both endpoints of the bridge are in the same connected component even if \( e \) was
        removed.

    <li>
        Assume \( u \) and \( v \) are in the same connected component of \( G' \). To prove their
        edge-biconnectedness, let \( e \) be any edge. If \( e \) is a bridge or lies outside of the connected
        component of \( u \) and \( v \), then trivially there exists a path from \( u \) to \( v \) that does not use
        \( e \). Otherwise, \( e \) must not be a bridge and that means that removing it from \( G \) does not change
        the connected components, i.e., \( u \) and \( v \) would still lie in the same connected component in
        \( G - e \). This means there exists a path from \( u \) to \( v \) in \( G - e \) and thus there exists a path
        in \( G \) that does not use \( e \) going from \( u \) to \( v \). Either way, we have a path from \( u \) to
        \( v \), proving that \( u \) is edge-biconnected to \( v \).
