<p>
    I am making a set of free computer science lessons. I want these lessons to be
    <a href="https://github.com/emilia-h/emilia-h.github.io">open source</a> like the rest of this website, easy to
    understand through visuals, and short each. See below for a list of available topics.

<p>Assumed knowledge: some high school level algebra (working with numbers and simple equations).</p>

<p><a href="/articles/classical-logic/1">Part 1: Logical Reasoning & Using Variables</a></p>

<p><a href="/articles/classical-logic/2">Part 2: Simple Proofs</a></p>

<p><a href="/articles/classical-logic/3">Part 3: Proofs with Contradictions</a></p>

<h2 id="algorithms"><a href="#algorithms">Computer Science - Algorithms (Visual and Interactive Explanations)</a></h2>

<p>
    I noticed that there is a lack of visual and interactive explanations of some slightly more advanced topics in
    graph theory and algorithms. For this reason, sporadically I make lessons about topics that are difficult to find
    information on.

<p>
    Biconnected components are an advanced to intermediate-level graph theory concept. They can be used to solve a lot
    of different graph problems. Assumed knowledge: what a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">(directed/undirected) graph</a> is. Notice that there are
    actually two kinds of biconnected components: vertex-biconnected components, which most online resources talk
    about, and edge-biconnectedness, which I find easier to explain first (the theory is just a little bit nicer).

<h2 id="formal-proving"><a href="#formal-proving">Computer Science - Formal Proving</a></h2>

<p>
    I sometimes write formal proofs in Rocq (AKA Coq) and I write about tricks that I discover or useful facts that I
    could not easily find on the internet.
