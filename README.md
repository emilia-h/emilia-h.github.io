The `robots.txt` file comes from <https://github.com/ai-robots-txt/ai.robots.txt> and is intended to (hopefully)
prevent "AI" companies from digesting the data on this website (i.e., nicely ask them if they could maybe not violate
my intellectual property ownership), so that my content is not digested by machine learning models and turned into a
soulless ugly stolen pile of garbage.
