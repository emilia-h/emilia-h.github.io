            <h2 id="an-example"><a href="#an-example">An Example</a></h2>

            <p>Take a look at the following statement:</p>

            <p><em>if it's not raining tomorrow then I'll go for a walk and I'll get ice cream.</em></p>

            <p>
                This statement has a couple of what we will call <strong>propositions</strong>, which are things that can either be
                true or false:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>it's raining tomorrow</li>
                <li>I'll go for a walk</li>
                <li>I'll get ice cream</li>
            </ul>

            <p>It also has a few <strong>connectives</strong> that relate these propositions to each other:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>if ... then ...</li>
                <li>not ...</li>
                <li>... and ...</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Math works the exact same way! For these propositions we can use variables, and for connectives we can use
                mathematical symbols known as operators.
            </p>

            <h2 id="propositions-and-connectives"><a href="#propositions-and-connectives">Propositions and Connectives</a></h2>

            <p>Let's replace the propositions with variables, and the connectives with operators:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>\( r \) to denote that it is raining tomorrow</li>
                <li>\( w \) to denote that I'll go for a walk</li>
                <li>\( c \) to denote that I'll get ice cream</li>
                <li>\( \lnot \) for "not ..."</li>
                <li>\( \Rightarrow \) for "if ... then ..."</li>
                <li>\( \land \) for "... and ..."</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Now we could write down the statement as follows, where the parentheses help to read the formula:</p>

            <p>\( (\lnot r) \Rightarrow (w \land c) \)</p>

            <h2 id="truth-tables-and-symbols"><a href="#truth-tables-and-symbols">Truth Tables and Symbols</a></h2>

            <p>
                A propositional variable such as \( w \) can be either <em>true</em> (written as 1, meaning I am actually going for
                a walk) or <em>false</em> (written as 0, meaning I am not going for a walk). These are known as
                <strong>boolean</strong> values.
            </p>

            <p>
                A boolean operator combines these boolean values into new boolean values, which is written in a
                <strong>truth table</strong>. For instance for \( a \land b \) (pronounced "\( a \) <strong>and</strong> \( b \)"),
                the truth table is:
            </p>

            <table class="compact-table">
                <tr><th>\( a \)</th><th>\( b \)</th><th>\( a \land b \)</th></tr>
                <tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
                <tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr>
                <tr><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
                <tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
            </table>

            <p>
                If you know the values for \( a \) and \( b \), then this table tells you the value for \( a \land b \). It shows
                that \( a \land b \) can only be true if both \( a \) is true AND \( b \) is true; otherwise, it is false.
            </p>

            <p>For \( a \lor b \) (pronounced "a <strong>or</strong> b") the truth table is:</p>

            <table class="compact-table">
                <tr><th>\( a \)</th><th>\( b \)</th><th>\( a \lor b \)</th></tr>
                <tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
                <tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
            </table>

            <p>
                Now an interesting question arises: if I say <em>"we can go to the mall or we can order from home"</em>, does that
                mean we can also do both? In other words, does the "\( \lor \)" operator include the possibility that both are
                true? In logic, the answer to this question is <strong>yes</strong>, and the \( \lor \) operator is therefore
                called "inclusive or". If you don't want this, you can use the so-called "exclusive or" operator (often shortened
                to "XOR" or "\( \oplus \)"), which has the following slightly different truth table (compare them!):
            </p>

            <table class="compact-table">
                <tr><th>\( a \)</th><th>\( b \)</th><th>\( a \oplus b \)</th></tr>
                <tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
                <tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr>
            </table>

            <p>
                It will turn out we don't really use the \( \oplus \) operator a lot in logic though. However, it is used a lot in
                computer programming and electronics.
            </p>

            <p>The "not" operator, written as \( \lnot \), takes only one boolean input and has a very simple truth table:</p>

            <table class="compact-table">
                <tr><th>\( a \)</th><th>\( \lnot a \)</th></tr>
                <tr><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr>
            </table>

            <p>
                We also had an "if ... then ..." connective, for which we use the \( \Rightarrow \) operator. \( a \Rightarrow b \)
                is often pronounced as "\( a \) <strong>implies</strong> \( b \)" or sometimes as "if \( a \) then \( b \)". The
                truth table is:
            </p>

            <table class="compact-table">
                <tr><th>\( a \)</th><th>\( b \)</th><th>\( a \Rightarrow b \)</th></tr>
                <tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
                <tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
            </table>

            <p>
                Once again an interesting question shows up. If I say, <em>"if it doesn't rain, I will get ice cream"</em>, and
                then it does rain and I still get ice cream? Does that mean my statement was a lie (it was false)?
            </p>

            <p>
                The answer is that you didn't really <em>say anything</em> about the case where it did rain. So if the proposition
                on the left is false, the logical formula is going to be true, which is why the truth table is the way it is.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you want to disallow this, there is still an option: you can use the \( \Leftrightarrow \) operator. \( a
                \Leftrightarrow b \) is often pronounced as "\( a \) <strong>if and only if</strong> \( b \)", often shortened to
                "\( a \) <strong>iff</strong> \( b \)" (not a typo!), and it has the following truth table (compare with the truth table for
                \( \Rightarrow \)):
            </p>

            <table class="compact-table">
                <tr><th>\( a \)</th><th>\( b \)</th><th>\( a \Leftrightarrow b \)</th></tr>
                <tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr>
                <tr><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
                <tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
            </table>

            <p>
                Don't worry if you think you might forget all these operator and truth tables. You will see these so often that
                you'll remember them soon enough, and I have a

            <p>
                You can also put more complicated formulas in a truth table. For instance, we can write out the truth table for the
                example above, with extra columns in between to show the intermediate steps (for <strong>subformulas</strong>
                \( \lnot r \) and \( w \land c\)):
            </p>

            <table class="compact-table">
                <tr>
                    <th>\( r \)</th>
                    <th>\( w \)</th>
                    <th>\( c \)</th>
                    <th>\( \lnot r \)</th>
                    <th>\( w \land c \)</th>
                    <th>\( (\lnot r) \Rightarrow (w \land c) \)</th>
                </tr>
                <tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
                <tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
                <tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
                <tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
            </table>

            <p>
                If we have a formula for which each row in the truth table results in a 1, this means that the formula is true no
                matter what input we give it. In this case, the formula is called a <strong>tautology</strong>. In the same way, if
                each row has a 0 as the result, that means the formula is always false and we call this a
                <strong>contradiction</strong>.
            </p>

            <h2 id="exercises"><a href="#exercises">Exercises</a></h2>

            <ol class="exercises">
                <li>
                    Write out the truth tables for the following formulas. Add columns for the subformulas.

                <li>
                    Which of the formulas in exercise 1 are tautologies? Which are contradictions? This should be easy to see from
                    the truth tables you made.

                <li>
                    If you have a truth table with \( n \) different variables, how many rows will it get?

            <h2 id="next-lesson"><a href="#next-lesson">Next Lesson</a></h2>

            <p>
                As you can see, the numbers of rows of the truth table grows really fast. For example, if we have 20 variables, we
                already get 1048576 rows, which is clearly not practical. For this reason, we need better techniques than simply
                listing all possibilities. This is something for in the next chapter!

            <p>Some final notes and disclaimers:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Notation used by people is often different. Some people use \( \Rightarrow \) and \( \Leftrightarrow \), others
                    use the thinner arrows \( \rightarrow \) and \( \leftrightarrow \). Some people write \( \mathit{true} \) for 1
                    and \( \mathit{false} \) for 0. Finally, sometimes a tautology is called a "valid" formula instead.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Parentheses are often unnecessary, so \( (\lnot r) \Rightarrow (w \land c) \) could also be written as
                    \( \lnot r \Rightarrow w \land c \). Just like how in algebra, \( a + b \cdot c \) is \( a + (b \cdot c) \) and
                    not \( (a + b) \cdot c \), there is an order to read operators in:

                    <ul>
                        <li>\( \Leftrightarrow \)</li>
                        <li>\( \Rightarrow \)</li>
                        <li>\( \land \), \( \lor \), \( \oplus \)</li>
                        <li>Other mathematical operators such as \( = \), \( \neq \), \( + \), \( \cdot \) etc. in their own order</li>
                        <li>\( \lnot \)</li>
                    </ul>

                    However, I advise you write out parentheses most of the time, except maybe with \( \lnot \).
